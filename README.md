#### The idea is to build a simple recommendation engine using a search engine(Solr). Ideally, recommendation-engine leverages machine learning for recommendations. This requires multi-dimensional data, but if data is simple and we don't care about the past behaviour of the user, search engine can be used as recommendation-engine. Although the recommendations will not be as precise but we save ourselves from building time-consuming & complex recommendation-engine. And this calculates items to recommend at real-time.
